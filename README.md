# Ramsey_10
Our project seeks to find the minimum number of guests that must be invited to an event so that at least 10 will know each other **or** at least 10 will not know each other. The solutions to this problem are known as Ramsey numbers. This project seeks to improve the known bounds on Ramsey(10,10), which is currently known as **798â€“23556**. From this, we know that the number of people that must be invited to an event so that at least 10 will know each other **or** at least 10 will not know each other is somewhere in that range.

More information on Ramsey Numbers can be found [here.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramsey%27s_theorem)

# Methods of Execution
In order to determine whether a number **m** of chosen nodes is not a Ramsey number for **R(10,10)**, we have to find a counter example which shows that with **m** nodes, it is not possible to form a clique which meets the requirements as described above. We use matrices of **m x m** to demonstrate these relationships and run those through `clique_count.c` to determine whether any cliques are present. If a chosen change to the relationship matrix produces a smaller clique count than a previous matrix held, that change will be considered a "good" change.

# Iterations and Technologies

## AWS Lambda
Our first iteration for attacking this problem will involve a server iterating through example matrices and pinging the AWS API Gateway (with the matrix as the payload) to spawn AWS Lambda functions to verify each matrix. Each lambda function can verify the counter example, and if it is not a counter example (clique count is not equal to zero), the function will ping a central server to see if the found clique count is smaller than the globally minimum saved clique count. If it is, it will flip a bit and invoke another lambda function to verify it, and also flip another bit to solve another version of the matrix locally.
